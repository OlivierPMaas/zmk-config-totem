# My ZMK config for the totem split keyboard

[Here](https://github.com/GEIGEIGEIST/totem) you can find the hardware files and build guide.

TOTEM is a 38-key column-staggered split keyboard.
My version is the Bluetooth version, assembled and provided by http://keep.supply.

Additionally, I am using a third SEEED XIAO BLE as a dongle.
